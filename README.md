# New-Grad-EU

### Description ###
www.newgrad.eu will be a job board application that will aim to provide computer science\
students and graduates the best experience when they search for open positions across\
EEA + UK.

### How will this application be competitive? ###

There are a lot of job board applications already, the most popular among them are LinkedIn,\
Indeed and Glassdoor. NewGrad plans to outshine them by providing quality over quantity, by \
implementing the following features:\
&emsp;• **Powerful filters**:\
&emsp;&emsp;This will help ensure that users seeking jobs will not spend time
looking at irrelevant jobs by\
&emsp;&emsp;providing features such as **specialization** *(Software, Machine Learning, Data Science, ...)*,\
&emsp;&emsp;required **education level** *(Bachelor Degree, Masters Degree, PhD)* and many more.\
&emsp;• **Relevance**:\
&emsp;&emsp;NewGrad plans to provide its users the best experience possible when searching for a job and\
&emsp;&emsp;its doing so by empowering job seekers, for example, with an option to report a job that does\
&emsp;&emsp;not meet our guidlines will be available *(ex: an internship position requiring 2+ yoe)*, careful\
&emsp;&emsp;filtering of the companies to avoid scam and promotional unrelated to the job.\
&emsp;• **Authenticity**:\
&emsp;&emsp;Recruiters can only create an account using their company email address. Their request to\
&emsp;&emsp;create an account will be handled manually by an admin, this is to ensure that recruiter is real\
&emsp;&emsp;and is hiring directly for the company (no sourcing companies).\
&emsp;&emsp;Job seeking users can create an account using their email or sign up via google or facebook.
