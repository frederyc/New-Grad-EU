### How will this application be competitive? ###

There are a lot of job board applications already, the most popular among them are LinkedIn,\
Indeed and Glassdoor. NewGrad plans to outshine them by providing quality over quantity.\
The most important features to be implemented are:\
&emsp;• **Powerful filters**:\
&emsp;&emsp;This will help ensure that users seeking jobs will not spend time
looking at irrelevant jobs by\
&emsp;&emsp;providing features such as **specialization** *(Software, Machine Learning, Data Science, ...)*,\
&emsp;&emsp;required **education level** *(Bachelor Degree, Masters Degree, PhD)* and many more.\
&emsp;• **Relevance**:\
&emsp;&emsp;NewGrad will strive to have quality content and will rely on its community for that. Entries\
&emsp;&emsp;posted are guaranteed to match their **seniority level**, users can report job posts that, for\
&emsp;&emsp;example, require 5+ years of experience for a junior position.\
&emsp;• **Authentication**:\
&emsp;&emsp;Creating an account for a user who seeks employment will be basic, email+password and\
&emsp;&emsp;other authentication methods. Recruiters can only create an account using their company\
&emsp;&emsp;email address. Their request to create an account will be handled manually by an admin,\
&emsp;&emsp;this is to ensure that recruiter are real and are hiring directly for the company (no sourcing\
&emsp;&emsp;companies).
